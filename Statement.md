- Create a lightweight local password manager.
- Provide a secure and random password generation feature.
- Allow users to store login credentials in an organized text file.
- Keep the program simple, user-friendly, and suitable for beginners.
- Focus only on *local storage* (no database, encryption, or online syncing in this version).

## **Target Users**
- Students and beginners learning Python GUI development.
- Individuals who need a basic tool to generate and store passwords locally.
- Anyone who wants a simple offline password manager.

## **High-Level Features**
- A complete Tkinter-based GUI interface.
- Automatic random password generator.
- Validate input fields before saving.
- Save credentials in a structured format (`website || email || password`).
- Easy to run, modify, and extend for future improvements.

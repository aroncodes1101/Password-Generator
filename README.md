# Password Manager & Generator
This project outlines the development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) password generator using Python's Tkinter library. Our goal is to create a user-friendly tool that generates strong, random passwords and securely stores them locally.

## **Overview**
This project is a simple GUI-based Password Manager built using Python and Tkinter.  
It allows users to generate strong passwords and securely store website login details (website, email/username, password) in a local text file.

## **Features**
- ✔️ Random strong password generator  
- ✔️ Stores website, email, and password into a file  
- ✔️ Input validation to prevent empty entries  
- ✔️ Simple and clean Tkinter user interface  
- ✔️ Auto-focus on input box for quick usage  
- ✔️ One-click password generation  

## **Technologies / Tools Used**
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI  
- **random** module – to generate secure passwords  
- **messagebox** – for confirmation and alerts  
- **File handling** – to store passwords locally (`password.txt`)

## **Steps to Install & Run the Project**
1. Install Python (version 3.7 or later).
2. Save the Python script (`main.py`) on your computer.
3. Make sure `logo.png` is removed if you're using the modified version.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the folder where the script is kept
6. Run the program
   
## **Instructions for Testing**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter:
- Website name  
- Email/username  
- Generate or manually enter a password  
3. Click **Add** to save credentials.
4. Open `password.txt` and verify the saved details.
5. Test error-handling by leaving fields empty and clicking **Add**.
6. Test password generation multiple times to ensure randomness.
